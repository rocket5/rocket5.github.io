## Works In Progress

### Kitty Disastrous
#### Experience life as a tiny, dangerous cat in a big world.

### Strangeways
#### Discover clues to your true identity in this VR adventure.
Strangeways is a Virtual Reality third-person action-adventure game. In Strangeways, you play as Agent Fox in an odyssey through a surreal landscape, desperately trying to piece together your lost identity. Mysterious masked villains try to stop you from collecting photographic evidence and clues that you'll need to reconstruct your lost memories on your crazy wall back at home base.

Strangeways is being develped with the financial support of the Ontario Media Development Corporation.

### Experiments and Prototypes
